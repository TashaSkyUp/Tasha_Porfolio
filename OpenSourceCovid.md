### Comparing open source contribution to covid case volume



#### Research question:
If people have more free time when they no longer have to commute to work, will they spend some of that time contributing to open source projects, like those on Github and Those of the Apache Sofware Foundation?

#### Hypothesis:
The more people who are working at home due to covid restrictions the more open source contributions people will find the time for.

#### Data sources
- Github contributions
- Apache software foundation contributions
- Covid case size
